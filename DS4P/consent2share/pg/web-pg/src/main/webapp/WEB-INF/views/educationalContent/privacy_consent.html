								<h2 id="HIP" class="blueheader">Health Information Privacy</h2>
								<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule protects your health information from being used and disclosed (shared) by health plans and health care providers without your consent. These protections are especially important where very sensitive information is concerned, such as mental health information. At the same time, the Privacy Rule recognizes that circumstances arise where health information may need to be shared to ensure that you receive the best treatment.

								<h3 id="federalLaw" class="blueheader top-margin15">Your Health Information Is Protected By Federal Law</h3>
								<p>Our mind and the parts of our body are all connected. They work together/in sync to share the responsibilities that keep us alive and productive. Our doctors should do the same thing for our health and connect with each other to ensure that all parts of our health are working together. 
		We have a revolutionary secure way to share your protected health information with all of your providers.  Your medical and other health information is private and should be protected, and you control who has this information. The Privacy Rule, a Federal law, gives you rights over your health information and sets rules and limits on who can look at and receive your health information. The Privacy Rule applies to all forms of individuals' protected health information, whether electronic, written, or oral. The Security Rule is a Federal law that requires security for health information in its electronic form.</p>

								<h2 class="blueheader top-margin15">Balancing Safety and Privacy</h2>
								<p>The HIPAA Privacy Rule is a law that helps you to protect your personal health information. The rule generally prohibits anyone from using or sharing your protected health information unless authorized by you. 
								The Privacy Rule sets rules and limits on who can look at and receive your health information. Your health information cannot be used or shared without your written permission unless this law allows it.
								</p>
								
								<p>When is it appropriate under the Privacy Rule for a health care provider to share the protected health information of a patient who is being treated for a mental health condition?  Read on to find the answer to this question, and a few other frequently asked questions about sharing your mental health information.</p>

								</div>
								
								<h2 id="HIPAA_share" class="blueheader top-margin15"> When does HIPAA permit health care providers to share mental health information?</h2>
								<p>HIPAA permits health care providers to:</p>
								<ul class="disc"> 
									<li>When a patient gives consent and does not object.</li>
									<li>Communicate with a patient's family members, friends, or others involved in the patient's care;</li>
									<li>Communicate with the parent of a patient who is a minor;</li>
									<li>Consider the patient's capacity to agree or object to the sharing of their information;</li>
									<li>Involve a patient's family members, friends, or others in dealing with patient failures to adhere to medication or other therapy;</li>
									<li>Listen to family members about their loved ones receiving mental health treatment;</li>
									<li>Communicate with family members, law enforcement, or others when the patient presents a serious and imminent threat of harm to self or others; and</li>
									<li>Communicate to law enforcement about the release of a patient brought in for an emergency psychiatric hold.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>In situations where the patient is given the opportunity and does not object, HIPAA allows the provider to share or discuss the patient's mental health information with family members or other persons involved in the patient's care or payment for care.  For example, if the patient does not object:
								</p>
								
								<ul class="disc">
									<li>A psychiatrist may discuss the drugs a patient needs to take with the patient's sister who is present with the patient at a mental health care appointment.</li>
									<li>A therapist may give information to a patient's spouse about warning signs that may signal a developing emergency.</li>
								</ul>
								<span>BUT:</span>
								<ul class="disc">
									<li>A nurse may not discuss a patient's mental health condition with the patient's brother after the patient has stated she does not want her family to know about her condition.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p>When in the best interest of the patient, the health care provider may share or discuss only the information that the person involved needs to know about the patient.  Examples include for payment for care, emergency circumstances, or if the patient is at risk for harming himself or herself or someone else.

								<h2 id="childsAge" class="blueheader top-margin15">At what age of a child is the parent no longer the personal representative of the child?</h2>
								<p>The Maryland State law is when the child is 18 years old.</p>
								<a href="#educationContent_list"><p class="backToTop">Back to top</p></a>
								 
								<h2 id="psychotherapy" class="blueheader topmargin15">Does a parent have a right to receive a copy of psychotherapy notes about a child's mental health treatment?</h2>
								<p>No.  The Privacy Rule distinguishes between mental health information and other notes in the medical record.  It does not provide the right of a parent to obtain any mental health notes recorded by a health care provider during a private counseling session or a group, joint, or family counseling session.
								</p>
