  <h1>Running the server</h1>

  <p>Before the logback-aduit server can be run, it must first be
  adapted to your local environment. The next few sections will take
  you through the process.</p>
    
  <h2>Creating the server application</h2>

  <p>In this section lists the steps required to create an
  logback-audit server instance adapted for your local
  environment. The resulting server instance is a web-application
  (.war file) which can be run in any J2EE application server.
  </p>

  <p>Altough Maven is not required to run logback-audit server,
  creating the server as explianed in this section assumes that you
  have installed Maven version 2.0.8 or later. </p>

  <p>Without further ado, let us begin creating a logback-audit server
  instance.</p>

  <p>First, copy <em>logback-audit/audit-server-generator/</em> folder
  which ships with logback-audit to a directory of your
  choice. Hereafter we refer to that directory as <code>$ASG</code>.
  </p>

  <p>Change your current directory to <code>$ASG</code>.</p>


  <p>Launch the command</p>
  
  <p class="source">mvn process-resources</p>

  <p>The above command will ask you two questions on the console.
  </p>

  <p class="source">Please enter the name of the group for this server: <b>com.wombat</b>
  
Please enter the project name for this server: <b>Eora</b></p>


  <p>In the above, let us assume that "com.wombat" is the name of the
  group (or orgnanisation) that will be running the server. Let "Eora"
  be the name of the server instance.</p>


  <p>If things went well, the "mvn process-resources" command should
  print "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" on the console. It should also have
  genereted a folder called <code>Eora</code> under <code>$ASG</code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>Change the current directory to the <code>$ASG/Eora</code>
  folder.</p>

  <p>You can build the server web-application with the command. </p>

  <p class="source">mvn package</p>

  <p>The resulting war file can be deployed in an application server
  of your choice. However, the audit-server is intended to be used
  along with a database which will persist audit events.
  </p>

  <h2>Choosing and configuring a database</h2>

  <p>Logback-audit can be used in conjuction with any database system
  supported by hibernate, the list includes HSQL, Microsoft SQL
  Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2 and many others.
  </p>

  <p>The server instance we generated previously includes a small
  application called CreateAuditTable.  It can connect to a target
  database and create the tables required by the logback-audit server
  instance.
  </p>

  <p>At this stage, it might convenient to import the server instance
  we created, namely Eura, into Eclipse.
  </p>
  
  <p>The Eclipse project view of the project can be generated with the
  "mvn eclipse:eclipse" command. Once that is done, import the project
  into your Eclipse workspace.</p>

  <p>Let us now customize Eora for HSQLDB.</p>
  
  <h3>HSQLDB</h3>

  <p>In this section, we will configure the server for HSQLDB, a very
  light-weight and easy to install database.
  </p>
  
  <p>You can obtain a copy of HSQLDB from the <a
  href="http://www.hsqldb.org/">project site</a>. Let $HSQLDB be the
  fodler where you unpacked the HSQLDB distribution.
  </p>

  <p>Setting the current directory to $HSQLDB, start the HSQLDB server
  with the name "audit". The appropriate command is:
  </p>

  <p class="source">java -cp lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.Server \
           -database.0 file:data/audit -dbname.0 audit</p>

           

  <p>Once you start the server, you can connect to it using an SQL
  client. <a href="http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/">SQuirreL</a>
  is a reasonably good and universal SQL client written in Java.
  </p>

  <p>Connection SQuirreL to our audit database requires the
  configuration of a HSQLDB driver. Select to modify the "HSQLDB
  Server" from the list of drivers shown when you start SQuirreL, as
  shown below.</p>

  <img src="../images/hsqldb_driver0.gif" alt="Modify HSQLDB Driver"/>

  <p>Select the "Extra Class Path" tab and add the file
  <em>hsqldb.jar</em> located under the <em> $HSQLDB/lib</em> folder
  (as shown below). Once the "org.jsqldb.jdbcDriver" is successfully
  registed for the driver definition "HSQLDB Server", add an alias for
  the audit database.
  </p>

  <img src="../images/hsqldb_driver1.gif" alt="Modify HSQLDB Driver"/>


  <p>Enter "Audit on HSQLDB" for the name of the alias, choose "HSQLDB
  Server" for the driver, enter the URL
  "jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/audit", and the password "sa", as
  shown below:
  </p>
  
  <img src="../images/hsqldb_alias.gif" alt="Add HSQLDB Alias"/>


  <h3>Customzing hibernate.properties</h3>

  <p>Logback-audit server uses Hibernate, allowing logback-audit to be
  compatible with various relational database systems. However, each
  database requires a minimal amount of configuration. This can be
  accomplished by adapting <em>hibernate.properties</em> file. There
  should already by a file named hibernate.properties under the
  <em>$ASG/Eora/src/main/resources/Eora/</em> folder, where $ASG
  stands for the location where you copied
  <em>logback-audit/audit-server-generator/</em>.
  </p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, you would need to customize this file
  for your environment. However, if you installed and started HSQLDB
  as presented previously, the <em>hibernate.properties</em> file
  should be appropriate for your HSQLDB instance running locally.</p>


  <h3>Creating the tables</h3>

  <p>For the logback-audit server depends on the existence of several
  tables to be present in the audit database. The next few paragraphs
  discuss the creation of these tables.
  </p>

  <p>The Eora project should contain a stand-alone Java application
  called <code>CreateAuditTables</code>. We recommend that you launch
  this command from within your IDE, for example Eclipse. 
  </p>

  <p>Launching "mvn eclipse:eclipse" command will generate the
  relevant eclipse project files from Eora's pom.xml file. After the
  eclipse project files are created, do import the Eora project into
  Eclipse.
  </p>

  <p>Once you have successfully imported the Eora project into
  Eclipse, search for the <code>CreateAuditTables</code> class and
  then launch it as a Java application. Assuming you have not changed
  the logging configration of teh Eora project, the following lines
  should appear on the console (edited for brevity):</p>

<p class="source">21:29:46.187 [main] INFO  org.hibernate.cfg.Environment - Hibernate 3.2.2
[snip] log messages removed for berevity
alter table PREDICATE_MAP drop constraint FK7E366E94A7D7F477
drop table AUDIT_EVENT if exists
drop table PREDICATE_MAP if exists
create table AUDIT_EVENT (EVENT_ID bigint generated by default as identity (start with 1), \
  TIMESTAMP timestamp not null, SUBJECT varchar(1024) not null, VERB varchar(64) not null, \
  OBJECT varchar(4096), ORG_APP_NAME varchar(64), ORG_APP_IP_ADDRESS varchar(48), \
  CLI_APP_NAME varchar(64) not null, CLI_APP_IP_ADDRESS varchar(48) not null, \
  primary key (EVENT_ID))
create table PREDICATE_MAP (EVENT_ID bigint not null, PREDICATE_VALUE varchar(4096), \
  PREDICATE_KEY varchar(64) not null, primary key (EVENT_ID, PREDICATE_KEY))
create index CLI_APP_NAME_IDX on AUDIT_EVENT (CLI_APP_NAME)
create index TIMESTAMP_IDX on AUDIT_EVENT (TIMESTAMP)
create index ORG_APP_NAME_IDX on AUDIT_EVENT (ORG_APP_NAME)
create index VERB_IDX on AUDIT_EVENT (VERB)
create index OBJECT_IDX on AUDIT_EVENT (OBJECT)
create index SUBJECT_IDX on AUDIT_EVENT (SUBJECT)
alter table PREDICATE_MAP add constraint FK7E366E94A7D7F477 foreign key (EVENT_ID) \
  references AUDIT_EVENT
21:29:46.671 [main] INFO  o.h.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport - schema export complete
21:29:46.671 [main] INFO  o.h.c.DriverManagerConnectionProvider - cleaning up \ 
  connection pool: jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost:9001/audit</p>
  

  <p>You can verify that the tables are creating by connecting to the
  database via SQuirrel. Under the "Audit on HSQLDB" alias, then
  "PUBLIC", and then "TABLE", you should see the AUDIT_EVENT and
  PREDICTE_MAP tables. Graphically, you see something akin to:
  </p>

  <img src="../images/hsqldb_table0.gif" alt="Add HSQLDB Alias"/>
  
  <h2>Starting the server</h2>

  <p>Once the hibernate.properties files is customized for your
  environment and the database tables are created, you can start the
  logback-audit server. The server is a war file that can be deployed
  in any application server.
  </p>

  <p>For the purposes of this document, you can also start the server
  within the Eora project itself. Assuming your current directory is
  $ASG/Eora/, start the server under Jetty. The command is:
  </p>

  <p class="source">maven jetty:run</p>

  <p>You should see jetty started and listening on port 8080, also
  meaning that logback-audit server is running under jetty. Once the
  logback-audit server is running, clients can connect to it and send
  audit messages which will be then persisted on the database.</p>

  <h2>Configuring the client</h2>

  <p>Now that we have a server running, let us configure a client
  application to log on the server.
  </p>

  
  <p>As in the <a href="introduction.html#first_baby_step">First
  BabyStep example</a> in the previous chapter, the next application
  logs a single audit message..</p>


<em>Example 1: First baby step (<a href="../xref/examples/SecondStep.html">audit-examples/src/main/java/examples/SecondStep.java</a>)</em>

<p class="source">package examples;

import ch.qos.logback.audit.AuditException;
import ch.qos.logback.audit.client.AuditorFacade;
import ch.qos.logback.audit.client.AuditorFactory;

public class SecondStep {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws AuditException {
    AuditorFactory.setApplicationName("SecondStep");
    new AuditorFacade("baby", "take", "step").audit();
  }
}</p>
  
  <p>Compared to the BabyStep example, the only change in the code
  affects the name of the application, that is "SecondStep" instead of
  "BabyStep". Setting the application name to "SecondStep" direct the
  logback-audit framework to search for the
  "SecondStep/logback-audit.xml" configuraiton file for the
  initialization of the framework.
  </p>

  <p>The contents of <a
  href="../audit-examples/resources/SecondStep/logback-audit.xml">
  <em>SecondStep/logback-audit.xml</em></a> are reproduced below:</p>

  
  <p class="source">&lt;auditor>
 &lt;appender name="server" class="ch.qos.logback.audit.client.net.SocketAuditAppender">
   &lt;remoteHost>localhost&lt;/remoteHost>
   &lt;port>9630&lt;/port>
 &lt;/appender>
&lt;/auditor></p>

  <p>Compared to the "First BasbtStep" exaple, the appender class has
  been changed to <code>SocketAuditAppender</code> instead of
  <code>SLF4JAuditAppender</code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>After executing the SecondStep appliation, the contents of your
  first persisted audit message should appear in the
  database. Connecting to our HSQLDB database with SQuirrel, you
  should see the event in the database, as shown in the figure below.
